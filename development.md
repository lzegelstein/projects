Week 1 (April 9- 16):
Our group has been struggling to get a solid proposal and throughout the week we have been working on the proposal. On Wednesday, we met with Professor Evans and discussed our first proposal. We decided to scrap the first proposal and create a new one on Thursday and Friday. Our new proposal had several issues brought up by Professor Evans and we found that the project would be not be plausible due to lack of data. On Friday night and Saturday, we created a new proposal that is more straightforward and detailed. In conclusion, this week have been gaining a more solid understanding of what this project entails and how we should approach the project.
