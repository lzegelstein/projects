Week 1 (April 9- 16):
Our group has been struggling to get a solid proposal and throughout the week we have been working on the proposal. On Wednesday, we met with Professor Evans and discussed our first proposal. We decided to scrap the first proposal and create a new one on Thursday and Friday. Our new proposal had several issues brought up by Professor Evans and we found that the project would be not be plausible due to lack of data. On Friday night and Saturday, we created a new proposal that is more straightforward and detailed. In conclusion, this week have been gaining a more solid understanding of what this project entails and how we should approach the project. 

Week 2 (April 17 - 23):
We were able to import the data, perform data cleaning through our code itself, and load it into a class we constructed called AirTravel. In this class, we assigned nodes as Airports, containing IATA 3-letter codes. Each of these nodes have a vector of destinations, which we populated by cleaning and importing routes data. Finally, our output creates a map of every Airport 3-letter code mapping onto the specific Airport Node. We also attempted to implement a DFS algorithm, however this was unsuccessful in performing a node traversal.
