### Reading and Writing Data:
Our Airport and AirTravel files read and write files from our data. Through these files, we made the data more readable for the program by removing quotations and detecting commas. We took the data we needed like the airport name, longitude, latitude, etc and created test cases using smaller data sets that we created called airports-short.csv and routes-short.csv. It reads the data needed correctly and can parse through the data with the use of commas. This can be tested by doing: module load llvm/6.0.1; make; make test; ./test [AirTravel]. The specifics for the test cases can be found in ../tests/testAirTravel.cpp. 

### Traverse Files:
As planned in our GOALS, we used DFS to traverse through our data. Our DFS and AirportTraversal files are based on the DFS and imageTraversal files in mp_traversals. We adapted the files to traverse through the data that we have created through the files listed under reading and writing data. The DFS works as it should and we tested it using our smaller data sets (airports-short.csv and routes-short.csv). We tested whether it started at the right point, whether it visited all of the nodes, if it visited all those nodes in the correct order, if it maintains a depth-first ordering, and if it maintains deepest point on top. The specifics for the test cases can be found in ../tests/testDFS.cpp. This can be tested by doing: module load llvm/6.0.1; make; make test; ./test [DFS].

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
As planned in our GOALS, we used Dijkstra’s algorithm and used what was taught in lecture as a foundation for the code. Our dijkstras files contain all the code for the algorithm and works properly as it can find the smallest path between all nodes. We have an additional function to find the smallest path between two nodes. We also made sure that it is not a multi edge graph. The algorithm can be tested by doing: module load llvm/6.0.1; make; make test; ./test [Dijkstras]. The test cases use our smaller data sets to check empty paths between nodes and the smallest path between nodes. The specifics for the test cases can be found in ../tests/testDijkstras.cpp.

### Graph:
We originally wanted to do a force directed graph, but it was changed to plot the x and y coordinates of the nodes. Our graph files hold the code that produces the nodes and draws the edges. It also has the algorithm to change the longitude and latitude to xy coordinates which will essentially make the nodes look like a mercurated map. Our graph output is able to display all the airport nodes as circles in an x-y coordinate system and display lines between airports to represent flights. This graph can be produced by doing: make; ./AirTravel. 

### Discoveries:
Through the combination of all our codes we are able to answer all of the questions in our GOALS. We were able to find that the busiest airport is Frankfurt am Main Airport. Our output successfully showed that there was a direct flight from RUT to JFK, and that there was a route under three stops from JFK to RUT. We also output a round trip from ORD to LYD, and those specific stops to the terminal.
