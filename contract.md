# **CS 225 Data Structures**
### *Team Contract: shree2*
## Communication:
#### Team Meetings 
Our team will meet at least twice a week every Tuesday and Thursday from 5-7 PM using Discord. We will meet for longer or on a different day if necessary. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with angelaj4. Notes will be stored in our shared Google folder, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly development log entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting.
####  Assistance  
Each team member can be contacted through email, Discord, Snapchat, or text message. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to messages within 48 hours. If a question is asked in a general group (i.e. Discord server)  anyone can answer. Questions for individuals should be asked in a private message (i.e. text or email).
#### Respect 
Whoever is the note-taker for the week is responsible for ensuring that the team meeting goes smoothly and meets the week goals. It is also the note-takers responsibility to ensure that every voice on the team is heard and that individuals ideas are implemented fairly. Decisions will be agreed upon by the group. In the event that one or more group members oppose, they should explain their reasoning and the final decision will be put to a team vote. If a simple majority is unable to be reached, the group should work towards an alternate solution. 


## Collaboration:
#### Work Distribution 
At the beginning of each meeting, the team members should discuss progress made on their assigned deliverables. The team should, as a whole, determine where the progress is in comparison to the proposed timeline. Assignments for the next week should be decided by the group and be voluntarily assigned. In the case that no one volunteers for deliverables, the projects will be assigned to pairs randomly by the note-taker for that week. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case by case basis. Despite working separately, when working as a group, a common understanding of the previous week’s deliverables and the current week’s deliverables must be reached.
#### Time Commitment 
Each member in the group is expected to put in at least 2 hours of work per week on their assigned deliverables but should not exceed 8 hours. If the group member is running into trouble with their deliverables they are expected to reach out for help as soon as possible via the Discord or other communication means. If the group member is still having trouble the entire team is expected to help debug the functions and the struggling member may be assigned to a different deliverable if someone with a different skill set is more capable. If the habitual lack of progress is due to a lack of effort, the team member in question will be politely asked to explain their circumstances. If an understanding cannot be reached, a staff member will be contacted.
#### Conflict Resolution 
If there is a disagreement on implementations, the disagreeing team members will peacefully debate their ideas and if a conclusion is not reached after each person explains their reasoning, each idea is brought to a whole team vote. In the case of a team member not doing their work or not showing up, the team will openly and peacefully confront the individual as to why there is an issue. If the team member in question cannot change habits a compromise will be made. In the event of failure to reach a compromise, a staff member will be alerted for further guidance.
